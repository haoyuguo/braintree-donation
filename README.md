# braintree-donation

This "quick-and-dirty" project is originally created for easily adding Braintree payment to a Drupal page.  It may not be elegant or concise, but it works.  

# Dependencies

## Bootstrap is used for styling and modal, to achieve a relatively better user experience.
## JQuery is required by Bootstrap 
## Braintree PHP library is required for server side steps
